## Description
Project for the 2017 Wells Fargo Data Analytics Challenge

I did not win this challenge. I think that the reasons being were;
1. I did not write good enough code as this was my first time using Python and had been coding for 3 months.
2. I did not write well enough in my write up and had a comment in my conclusion, about how good products are made by people that actually care, that was innapropriate for the situation.
